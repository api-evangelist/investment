<p>These are the open source tools I am tracking on as part my API definition research, that can be applied across the API life cycle.</p>

<table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td align="center" valign="middle" height="100" width="25%">
        <p><a href="frameworks/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-framework.png" width="130" /></a></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>If there is an open source tool that should be listed here, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">submit as a Github Issue, and I will consider adding</a>, if it is open source, and fits into this API definition research.</p>
